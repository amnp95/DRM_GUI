uniaxialMaterial Types
======================

This section will document the uniaxial material models available in MeshMaker.

.. note::
   Documentation for uniaxial materials will be added in a future update.

uniaxialMaterial models are used for one-dimensional elements such as truss elements, some beam formulations, and zero-length spring elements.

* Steel01 - Uniaxial bilinear steel material with kinematic hardening
* Concrete01 - Uniaxial Kent-Scott-Park concrete material with degraded linear unloading/reloading
* Elastic - Simple linear elastic uniaxial material
* And more...
